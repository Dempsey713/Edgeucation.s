step 1: Figure out how to get PyQt to work
2: Figure out how to get PyQt Designer to work
3: make a basic-ass GUI
    - have a window that pops up and says something
    - create this using PyQt Designer
4: make a GUI that is less basic (add buttons and things)
    - A simple Calculator
        - display
5: make the framework for the GUI that will actually be used
    - a console window (not necissarily with the console in it yet)
    - a window for Graphviz (again, not with graphviz actually in it yet)
    - a button panel to the side
    - menu buttons along the top
6: add console functionality to console window
7: make NetworkX work with said console in a way that you can use it just by opening the app
8: do step 6-7 for Graphviz
9: make graphviz and networkX work together somehow
10: start adding basic custom functionality
    - add node button that interacts with graphviz window somehow
    - add edge button
    - color node/edge
    - number/letter node/edge

STRETCH
Will add later when/if relevant. The above represents basic functionality, and anything that could be considered
"stretch" should be ignored for now.
